# VigenereCipher
Assignment for MAT542 - Cryptography

This project implement Vigenere cipher as a cryptosystem and contains basic cryptanalysis for known plain-text attacks
and ciphertext-only attacks.

However, the implementation of ciphertext-only attack is incomplete but implementable using
a) brute-force over the keyspace, checking which plaintext makes sense, or
b) frequency analysis over the alphabets
